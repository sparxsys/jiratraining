## Jira 7 Essentials (Video Course)

In this course, we start by introducing you to Jira and taking you through all aspects of it so you can use it effectively; if you have never deployed Jira before then this course is for you. We cover how to plan the installation of Jira. Then you will learn the fundamentals of the tool such as how to create a new project, manage issues, search, and report. We explain all three flavors of Jira—Jira Core, Jira Software, and Jira Service Desk—in detail and specific scenarios for each one of them will be developed. Finally, we share some tips on getting the most out of Jira.
